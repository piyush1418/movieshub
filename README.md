# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommendation System

A simple and effective movie recommendation system that suggests movies based on user preferences using collaborative and content-based filtering techniques.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project implements two popular recommendation strategies:

1. **Collaborative Filtering:** Suggests movies based on similar usersâ€™ behavior using the MovieLens dataset.
2. **Content-Based Filtering:** Recommends movies based on features like genres, keywords, and descriptions.

You can use this system to generate personalized movie recommendations, much like Netflix or IMDb.
